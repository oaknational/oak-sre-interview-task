# Task: Python

A technical exercise for SRE interviews, exploring coding approach and API interactions.

The script is written in Python3, and the Python3 runtime is used to execute it.

## Pre-requisites

You must have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine.

Check out the code, and run the installation steps as listed below.

## Getting started

- run `python3 -m venv env` to create a virtual environment
- run `. env/bin/activate` to activate the environment
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
- run `python main.py` to run the script

To test functions, import them into `test_main.py` and run `pytest`
